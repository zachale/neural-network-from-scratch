**Why did I build this?**

I created this neural network to dip my toes into machine learning algorithms.

I have always found machine learning fascinating and this project has made me appreciate it more

**The Fundamentals**

This neural network can be used to learn data sets of 2 dimensions input, one dimension output.
So if your data set say has 2 different properties that need to map to a binary yes/no decision, this will work!
This is a little bit limiting, but the hidden layers can be any size and can be scaled to be able to learn on complex data sets.

This script creates a grayscale visualization at each learning step, so you can compare it to the base image and see how much more it needs to learn!


**Instructions**

Change the base png to a *square* image of any size! (preferably 50px width or smaller)
In main.py you can see example code for the neural network. 
you can tweak how many nodes are in each layer of the network before you try and brute force it

have fun!

**WishList: ToDo**

- implement a backwards propagation algorithm
- allow for input/output layers of any size
