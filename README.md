**Neural Work**

I created this neural network to dip my toes into machine learning algorythims.

I have always found machine learning ffascinating and this project has made me appreciate it more

**Limitations**

Backwards propagation is currently not supported by this script.
I am finding it more difficult to implement than I intially thought.

**Instructions**

change base png to any *square* image of any size! (preferably 50px or smaller)
In main.py you can see example  code for the neural network. 
you can tweak how many nodes are in each layer of the network before you try and brute force it

have fun!
